        <h4>But in the U.S., we’ve collectively decided that it’s impossible to create a community owned,
         operated, and led service of any serious scale — that most of us need a corporate behemoth like Comcast or Verizon for our connections. 
         To make matters worse, the Federal Communications Commission went ahead with its deeply unpopular plan to end net neutrality protections, 
        giving those same corporate-behemoth internet service providers like AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast unprecedented control of our experience online.  
        </h4>
        <br/>
        <h4>However, all is not lost. In the short time since the FCC’s net neutrality ruling, interest in community-run ISPs has grown rapidly. 
        What if we could encourage community networks to flourish, AND, create a platform for user-run networks to collaborate and ultimately connect to one another?
